# Hi 👋 I’m Junior

😏 I try to work with some Xamarin projects in my free time (🤦‍♂️ kinda).

😅 Currently I work in the development of an in house ERP at Richline Group.

🥰 I like .Net but love technology more so I'm always looking for new things.

😁 I'm "polishing" my mobile and web development skills.

🧐 I’m looking to collaborate on mobile or web projects but I'm open help in any other kind of project you may been on.

📫 If you want to you can reach me at jk_92@live.com
